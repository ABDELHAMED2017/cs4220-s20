You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

% Cholesky

% Basic least squares

\paragraph*{1: Describing definiteness}
Suppose $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is symmetric and positive definite.
Give {\em brief} proofs of each of the following facts
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is invertible.
\item $A^{-1}$ is positive definite.
\item Any principal submatrix is positive definite.
\item Any Schur complement is positive definite.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{2: Beyond Cholesky}
Suppose $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is symmetric and positive definite
and $B \in \bbR^{n \times k}$ has full column rank (with $k < n$).
Argue for the existence of the factorization
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ B^T & 0 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} L_{11} & 0 \\ L_{12} & L_{22} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\ 0 & -I \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} L_{11} & 0 \\ L_{12} & L_{22} \end{bmatrix}^T
\]
and give a short code (using all the standard built-ins) to
compute this factorization in the language of your choice.

\paragraph*{3: Recover the map}
Suppose we are given $N$ pairs
$(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \in \bbR^n \times \bbR^n$.  Write a short
code (in any language) to solve
\[
  \mbox{minimize } \sum_{i=1}^N \|y^{(i)}-Ax^{(i)}\|^2
  \mbox{ over } A \in \bbR^{n \times n}
\]
You may use built-in functions for solving least squares.
Illustrate your code on a sample set of points.
