You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Growing a system}
Suppose $PA = LU$ is given.  Write an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm to
extend the factorization to an LU factorization of
\[
  M = \begin{bmatrix} A & b \\ c^T & d \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Write your code as a function that takes $P$, $L$, $U$, $b$, $c$, and
$d$ as inputs, and returns extended matrices $\bar{P}$, $\bar{L}$, and
$\bar{U}$.  You should verify that your code is correct for random
choices of $A$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by checking the backward error,
i.e.~$\|\bar{P} M - \bar{L} \bar{U}\|_F / \|M\|_F$ should be small.

\paragraph*{2: Shrinking back}
Suppose $PA = LU$ is given.  Consider the system $Ax = b + r e_i$
where $x_j = 0$; that is, we allow the $i$th equation not to be
satisfied (by an unknown amount $r$), but enforce that $x_j = 0$.
Express this new problem in terms of a bordered system, and use
block elimination to give an $O(n^2)$ code to compute $x$ and $r$.

\paragraph*{3: Iterative refinement and bordering}
The straightforward algorithm in problem 2 runs into stability
problems when $A$ is nearly rank deficient, even if the modified
system is well-conditioned.  Illustrate the problem with the
matrix
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1+\delta \end{bmatrix}
\]
for $\delta = 10^{-12}$.  Show experimentally that a step of iterative
refinement fixes the issue.
